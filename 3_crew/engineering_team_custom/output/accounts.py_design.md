# Module Design for `accounts.py`

## Overview

This `accounts.py` module will implement an account management system for a trading simulation platform. It will include a class called `Account`, which handles the creation of user accounts and operations such as deposit, withdrawal, buying and selling shares, and calculating the total value and profit/loss of the portfolio. The system will ensure users cannot withdraw more funds than available, buy more shares than affordable, or sell shares they do not own. This module will utilize an external function `get_share_price(symbol)` to retrieve current share prices.

## Class and Functions

### Class: `Account`

#### Attributes:

- `username`: `str`
  - The name of the account holder.
- `balance`: `float`
  - The current cash balance in the account.
- `initial_deposit`: `float`
  - The initial amount deposited by the user when the account is created.
- `holdings`: `dict`
  - A dictionary storing the number of shares held for each symbol.
- `transactions`: `list`
  - A list storing the history of transactions made by the user.

#### Methods:

- `__init__(self, username: str, initial_deposit: float) -> None`
  - Initialize a new account with the username and initial deposit.
  - Set initial deposit as the initial balance.
  - Set `holdings` as an empty dictionary and `transactions` as an empty list.

- `deposit(self, amount: float) -> None`
  - Increase the balance by the specified amount.
  - Record the transaction in the transactions list.

- `withdraw(self, amount: float) -> bool`
  - Decrease the balance by the specified amount if sufficient balance is available.
  - Return `True` if the withdrawal is successful, otherwise `False`.
  - Record the transaction if successful.

- `buy_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool`
  - Buy a specific quantity of shares of the given symbol if enough balance is available.
  - Decrease the balance by the total purchase cost.
  - Update the holdings and record the transaction.
  - Return `True` if the purchase is successful, otherwise `False`.

- `sell_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool`
  - Sell a specific quantity of shares of the given symbol if enough shares are available in holdings.
  - Increase the balance by the total sale value.
  - Update the holdings and record the transaction.
  - Return `True` if the sale is successful, otherwise `False`.

- `calculate_portfolio_value(self) -> float`
  - Calculate and return the total current value of all holdings using `get_share_price`.

- `calculate_profit_loss(self) -> float`
  - Calculate and return the difference between current portfolio value and initial deposit.

- `get_holdings(self) -> dict`
  - Return a dictionary of current holdings.

- `get_profit_loss(self) -> float`
  - Calculate and return net profit or loss using `calculate_profit_loss`.

- `get_transactions(self) -> list`
  - Return a list of all transactions recorded.

### External Dependency

- `get_share_price(symbol: str) -> float`
  - External function used within methods for real-time share price fetching.

## Example Usage

This section gives a quick idea of how the `Account` class and its methods can be used. Detailed examples and test cases should be added in a separate testing script.

```python
from accounts import Account

# Assuming a function definition that returns mock share prices for simplicity
def get_share_price(symbol):
    prices = {'AAPL': 150, 'TSLA': 600, 'GOOGL': 2800}
    return prices.get(symbol, 100)  # Default price is 100 if symbol not found

# Create a new account
acct = Account("user1", 1000.0)

# Deposit funds
acct.deposit(500.0)

# Attempt to buy shares
acct.buy_shares('AAPL', 2)  # Buys 2 shares of AAPL if balance allows

# Sell shares
acct.sell_shares('AAPL', 1)  # Sells 1 share of AAPL if holdings allow

# Withdraw funds
acct.withdraw(200.0)

# Check holdings
print(acct.get_holdings())

# Check profit/loss
print(acct.get_profit_loss())

# List transactions
print(acct.get_transactions())
```

This module design is fully prepared for any backend developer to implement, test, and build upon, ensuring all functionalities meet the stated requirements.
