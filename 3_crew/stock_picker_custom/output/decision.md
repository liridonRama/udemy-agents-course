Detailed Investment Report:

**Chosen Company: Okta (OKTA)**
- **Reason for Selection:** Okta stands out for its superior growth potential in the rapidly expanding cybersecurity sector. The company is acknowledged as a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Access Management, reflecting strong market positioning. It projects earnings growth of 24.9% per year and revenue growth of 8.8% annually, higher compared to Qualcomm. Despite previous setbacks, recent adjustments in price targets and strategic alignment with increasing demand for cloud-based security solutions suggest a promising upward trend. These factors, combined with its leadership and solid customer footing, make Okta a more compelling investment in light of current market dynamics.

**Companies Not Selected:**
1. **Qualcomm (QCOM):**
   - **Reason for Non-selection:** While Qualcomm showcases a dominant presence in the 5G chipset market and has managed to proactively address security vulnerabilities, its projected growth rates (earnings at 2.2% and revenue at 2.8%) are notably lower than Okta's. Despite its undervaluation and healthy fundamentals, the upside potential is substantial, but the future growth trends in cybersecurity favor Okta due to the accelerating demand induced by rising cyber threats.

In conclusion, while Qualcomm remains a solid investment due to its market leadership in 5G and robust innovation track record, Okta's alignment with burgeoning cybersecurity needs, alongside higher growth metrics, presents a more attractive investment opportunity at this juncture.
