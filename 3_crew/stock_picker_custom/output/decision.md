Chosen Company:
- **AMD (Advanced Micro Devices)**
  - **Why Chosen**: AMD was selected due to its established strong position in the semiconductor industry, which includes significant market share in both CPUs and GPUs. The company is poised for continued growth thanks to its strategic advancements in AI technology and recent strategic acquisitions. This growth is backed by AMD's robust historical performance and strategic positioning in the rapidly advancing technology landscape, making it a highly reliable choice for investment.

Not Selected:
- **DeepSeek**
  - **Why Not Selected**: While DeepSeek operates in a promising niche market at the intersection of cultural tech and spiritual connection products, its investment potential is moderate to high but largely contingent on its ability to capture market size and achieve user adoption. The sector requires strong marketing efforts to ensure extensive reach, presenting higher risk compared to more established players like AMD.

- **Various AI Startups**
  - **Why Not Selected**: AI Startups, although exhibiting high growth potential as AI adoption expands, present varying degrees of risk. The fragmented nature of the sector makes it challenging to pinpoint consistent winners. Investment strategy requires discerning focus on startups with strong leadership and a clear market strategy, making them less straightforward compared to the well-defined growth path anticipated for AMD.
